The dust jacket from her copy of Where the Wild Things Are rests on my bedroom floor. I hold it in my hands every night, picturing the ragged book that she took with her still nestled inside. As my finger traces through the textured coating, the sound is eerily similar to the moment it landed on my floor – a gentle, reckless act of abandon.

Sometimes, I wonder if she knew what she was leaving behind. Did she understand the weight of this discarded shell, this remnant of childhood tossed aside in her haste to grow up? The book itself, worn and loved, traveled with her into whatever wild rumpus she sought. But this cover, with its faded colors and dog-eared corners, became my inheritance – a constant reminder of what was and what could have been.
